In some cases, if you have R Markdown files, markdown files, or even better, a bookdown set of files in an existing repository that you would like OTTR-fy you can do that following these steps.
This method is a bit trickier and riskier than creating a repository from scratch and is still under some testing.
So we recommend generally avoiding this strategy unless its unavoidables.

This set of steps also assumes you are more familiar with GitHub.

## Requirements for OTTR-fying a repository:

- Need to have either markdown or R Markdown documents in the top of your repository that you are seeking to publish.
- Needs to be a GitHub Public repository.

### 1. Add OTTR files to your current repository

Navigate to the top of your repository.

[Download this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/main/scripts/ottr-fy.R).

```
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/main/scripts/ottr-fy.R'
```

You've downloaded a script that will download the necessary files to run OTTR in your repository. Take a look at the filenames of what will be downloaded to make sure that you won't accidentally overwrite any of your repository's existing files.

### OTTR-fying files:

#### Files you won't need to edit

- .github/workflows/pull_request.yml
- .github/workflows/render-all.yml
- .github/workflows/delete-preview.yml
- .github/workflows/docker-build.yml
- scripts/git_repo_check.R
- scripts/make_screenshots.R
- scripts/quiz-check.R
- scripts/spell-check.R
- scripts/url-check.R
- assets/toc_close.css

#### Files you'll need to edit to customize

- _bookdown.yml
- _output.yml
- book.bib
- assets/big-image.html
- assets/footer.html

#### File you will likely want to edit but don't have to

- config_automation.yml
- assets/style.css

If you are sure your own files won't be overwritten, run this this script from your command line:
```
Rscript ottr-fy.R
```

After this runs and downloads these files, you'll want to commit these files to your GitHub.
Make sure to commit this to your branch/repository. 

### 2. Add your Rmd or md files to the `_bookdown.yml` file

[Follow these instructions](https://www.ottrproject.org/writing_content.html#Step_2_Add_the_name_of_your_new_chapter_to_your__bookdownyml_file) to add your Rmds and mds to the _bookdown.yml file.

Make sure to commit this to your branch/repository.

### 3. Set up your repository with the proper settings

From here, you can follow the rest of the steps described in the [Getting Started section](https://www.ottrproject.org/getting_started.html#5_Add_jhudsl-robot_as_a_collaborator).
