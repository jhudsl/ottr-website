By default, all automation steps and checks will run. But depending on the needs of your course, you can turn these on and off by going to the `config_automation.yml` file and switching options to `yes` or `no`.

The `config_automation.yml` file looks like this:

```
# Formatting Checks (run at pull request)
check-quizzes: yes
url-checker: yes
render-preview: yes
style-and-sp-check: yes
...
```

There are two main sets of automation steps and checks run:
- `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml` : run upon opening a pull request
- `.github/workflows/render-all.yml`: run upon changes being merged to the `main` branch

## Pull request checks:

These actions are triggered upon a pull request being opened. It's set up is in the file: `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml`/.

### Check quiz formatting
In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
check-quizzes: no
```
By default, it is set to `no`. But if you wish to [create quizzes on Leanpub](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Publishing-on-Leanpub), you should set this to `yes`. This is not necessary if you only want quizzes for Coursera.
Leanpub needs a particular format for it to upload correctly. This action will look for quizzes in a `quizzes` directory and check for these items. The outcome of these quiz checks will be printed to a GitHub comment on your pull request.

### Check for broken URLs
In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
url-checker: yes
```

GitHub actions runs a check on all the URLs upon creating a pull request to the `main` branch.
If it fails, you can click on the output comment on your pull request that says "Download errors here". This will give you a print out of the broken urls it found.

If the URL checker is failing on something that isn't really a URL or doesn't need to be checked, open the `resources/ignore-urls.txt` file and add that url exactly as it is specified in the error print out.

### Preview rendering
In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
render-preview: yes
```
After you open a pull request, a preview of the renders will be linked in a automatic comment on the pull request. Upon each commit these previews will re-render and edit the comment with the latest render.

These Github Actions are located in `render-preview` section of the `pull-request.yml`.
These previews do NOT incorporate any changes influenced by any changes to the Docker image if the Dockerfile is also updated in the same pull request.


### Spell checking
In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
spell-check: yes
```
Github actions will automatically [run a spell check on all Rmd's and md's](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/blob/main/.github/workflows/style-and-sp-check.yml) whenever a pull request to the `main` branch is filed.

It will fail if there are more than 2 spelling errors and you'll need to resolve those before being able to merge your pull request. Errors will be printed out on a GitHub comment on your pull request.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/main/resources/screenshots/spell_check_comment.png)

To resolve those spelling errors, click on the link with the errors on the autogenerated comment.
Some of these errors may be things that the spell check doesn't recognize for example: `ITCR` or `DaSL`.
If it's a 'word' the spell check should recognize, you'll need to add this to the dictionary.

Go to the `resources/dictionary.txt` file.
Open the file and add the new 'word' to its appropriate place (the words are in alphabetical order).
Then commit the changes to `resources/dictionary.txt` to your branch and this should make the spell check status check pass.

### Style code
In the config_automation.yml file it is set by:
```
style-code: yes
```
The `styler` package to all style R in all Rmds.
Style changes will automatically be committed back to your branch.

### Docker testing
In the config_automation.yml file it looks like:
```
docker-test: no
```
By default it is set to `no` which means it won't run automatically unless you change this to `yes`.
This is only relevant if you have [your own Docker image you are managing for your course](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Using-Docker#starting-a-new-docker-image). If changes are made to Docker-relevant files: `Dockerfile`, `install_github.R`, or `github_package_list.tsv`, this will test re-build the Docker image. If it is successfully built, then it makes sense to merge it to `main` but the docker image will not be pushed to `Dockerhub` automatically. [Follow these instructions to push your Docker image to Dockerhub](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Using-Docker#pushing-the-docker-image).

## Rendering actions

Upon merging changes to any `Rmd` or `assets/` folder to `main`, the course material will be automatically re-rendered.
By default, all rendering steps will be run. But depending on the needs of your course, you can turn these on and off by going to the `config_automation.yml` file and switching options to `yes` or `no`.

```
render-bookdown: yes
render-leanpub: yes
render-coursera: yes
```
For publishing to Leanpub, make sure that the render Leanpub option is set to yes: `render-leanpub: yes`.  [See more details about publishing to Leanpub, here](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Publishing-on-Leanpub).

For publishing to Coursera, make sure render Coursera option is set to yes: `render-coursera: yes`. [See more details about publishing to Coursera, here](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Publishing-on-Coursera).

## Manually running rendering or checks

From time to time, it may be useful to manually re-trigger a particular GitHub action. Most of the GitHub Actions, particularly the rendering ones, can be re-run manually. See this article about [how to manually re-run a GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow).

## Fixing broken GitHub Actions

GitHub action rendering or other GitHub actions may fail sometimes if the input is unexpected or for a number of other reasons.
To investigate why a GitHub action has failed, go to `Actions` and click on the failed action. [See this article for how to find this information](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-workflows-activity).

If you are unsure what the error message means and have trouble addressing it, please [file an issue on the OTTR_Template repository to get help](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/issues/new?assignees=cansavvy&labels=bug&template=course-template-problem-report.md).
