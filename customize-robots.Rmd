By default, all automation steps and checks will run. Based on the requirements of your course, you have the flexibility to enable or disable specific features by modifying the settings in the `config_automation.yml` file. Simply adjust the options to "yes" or "no" accordingly.

The `config_automation.yml` file looks like this:

```
# Formatting Checks (run at pull request)
check-quizzes: yes
url-checker: yes
render-preview: yes
style-and-sp-check: yes
url-check-periodically: yes
...
```

There are two main sets of automation steps and checks run:

- `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml` : Run upon opening a pull request
- `.github/workflows/render-all.yml`: Run upon any changes merged to the `main` branch


You can exclude files from being checked for URLs and spelling by adding them to the `resources/exclude_files.txt` file. This file is read in by the spell checker and URL checker and files and directories listed are excluded. This is regex compatible so for example `docs/*` will make sure the whole docs folder is ignored.

## Pull Request Checks:

These actions are triggered upon a pull request being opened. They are set up in the file: `.github/workflows/pull-request.yml`/.

### Check Quiz Formatting

In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:

```
check-quizzes: no
```

By default, it is set to `no`. But if you wish to [create quizzes on Leanpub](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Publishing-on-Leanpub), you should set this to `yes`. This is not necessary if you only want quizzes for Coursera.
Leanpub needs a particular format for it to upload correctly. This action will look for quizzes in the `quizzes` directory and check for these items. The outcome of these quiz checks will be printed to a GitHub comment on your pull request.

### Check for broken URLs

In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
url-checker: yes
```

GitHub Actions runs a check on all the URLs upon creating a pull request to the `main` branch.
If it fails, you can click on the output comment on your pull request that says "Download errors here". This will give you a print out of the broken URLs it found.

If the URL checker is failing on something that isn't really a URL or doesn't need to be checked, open the `resources/ignore-urls.txt` file and add that URL exactly as it is specified in the error print out.

### Preview rendering

In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
render-preview: yes
```
After you open a pull request, a preview of the renders will be linked in an automatic comment on the pull request. Upon each commit these previews will re-render and edit the comment with the latest render.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/main/resources/screenshots/preview_comment.png)

These Github Actions are located in `render-preview` section of the `pull-request.yml`.
These previews do NOT incorporate any changes influenced by any changes to the Docker image if the Dockerfile is also updated in the same pull request.


### Spell checking

In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
spell-check: yes
```
Github Actions will automatically run a spell check on all Rmds and mds whenever a pull request to the `main` branch is filed.

It will fail if there are more than 2 spelling errors and you'll need to resolve those before being able to merge your pull request. Errors will be printed out on a GitHub comment on your pull request.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/main/resources/screenshots/spell_check_comment.png)

To resolve those spelling errors, click on the link with the errors on the autogenerated comment.
Some of these errors may be things that the spell check doesn't recognize for example: `ITCR` or `DaSL`.
If it's a 'word' the spell check should recognize, you'll need to add this to the dictionary.

Go to the `resources/dictionary.txt` file. Open the file and add the new 'word' to its appropriate place (the words are in alphabetical order).
After committing the changes to `resources/dictionary.txt` on your branch, the spell check status check should be successfully passed.

### Style code

In the `config_automation.yml` file it is set by:
```
style-code: yes
```
The `styler` package will style R code in all Rmds. Style changes will automatically be committed back to your branch.

### Docker testing

In the config_automation.yml file it looks like:
```
docker-test: no
```
By default it is set to `no` which means it won't run automatically unless you change this to `yes`.
This is only relevant if you have [your own Docker image you are managing for your course](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Using-Docker#starting-a-new-docker-image). If changes are made to Docker-relevant files: `Dockerfile`, `install_github.R`, or `github_package_list.tsv`, this will test re-build the Docker image. If it is successfully built, then it makes sense to merge it to `main` but the Docker Image will not be pushed to `Dockerhub` automatically. [Follow these instructions to push your Docker image to Dockerhub](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Using-Docker#pushing-the-docker-image).

## Rendering actions

Upon merging changes to any `Rmd` or `assets/` folder to `main`, the course material will be automatically re-rendered.
By default, all rendering steps will be run. But depending on the needs of your course, you can turn these on and off by going to the `config_automation.yml` file and switching options to `yes` or `no`.

```
render-bookdown: yes
render-leanpub: yes
render-coursera: yes
```
For publishing to Leanpub, make sure that the render Leanpub option is set to yes: `render-leanpub: yes`.  See more details about publishing to Leanpub [here](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Publishing-on-Leanpub).

For publishing to Coursera, make sure render Coursera option is set to yes: `render-coursera: yes`. See more details about publishing to Coursera [here](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/wiki/Publishing-on-Coursera).

## Periodic URL checker

Sometimes you might not have mad any changes to your course, but a URL referenced changes making it so the URL you have in your course is now obsolete! To alert you of this kind of URL break, there is `url-check-periodically: yes`.

By default this check runs once a month and if a broken URL is found, an issue will be filed to your repository. You can adjust the frequency that this runs by adjusting the cron setting in the `.github/workflows/url-checker.yml` file. Use https://crontab.guru/#*_*_*_* to help you figure out the cron you want.

## Manually running rendering or checks

From time to time, it may be useful to manually re-trigger a particular GitHub Action. Most of the GitHub Actions, particularly the rendering ones, can be re-run manually. See this article about [how to manually re-run a GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow).

## Fixing broken GitHub Actions

GitHub action rendering or other GitHub actions may fail sometimes if the input is unexpected or for a number of other reasons.
To investigate why a GitHub action has failed, go to `Actions` and click on the failed action. [See this article for how to find this information](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#viewing-the-workflows-activity).

See our [FAQ's section](./faqs.html) for the most commonly encountered errors and how to address them.

If you are unsure what the error message means and have trouble addressing it, please [file an issue on the OTTR_Template repository to get help](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/issues/new?assignees=cansavvy&labels=bug&template=course-template-problem-report.md).
