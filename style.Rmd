## Navigation bar

To change the part of the navigation bar that says "OTTR Web", modify the title within the `_site.yml` file.


```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Change nav bar", echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/navbar.png")
```


## Overall theme

To change the color scheme/fonts of the website modify the `theme` in the `_site.yml` file (see [here](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) for options):

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Change theme", echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/theme.png")
```


## Additional changes

To make additional changes to the style, you can modify the `styles.css` file with css code. This [website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) has great information about css code.

As an example if you wanted to change the color of the blue line to green you could change where it says lightblue to lightgreen in the `styles.css` file.


```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Change color of line", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/blue.png")
```

Note that if you change the css file with a new element that is not already defined like `body` then you would need to do it as done with the `banner` element. This was then added to the index.Rmd file by using:

```
<div class = "banner">
Banner text!  
</div>
```
