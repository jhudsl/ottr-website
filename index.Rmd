OTTR is a set of tools and documentation to make course publishing maintenance across multiple different platforms _less painful_.

- Edit and write a course in [R Markdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and have it published to multiple different platforms:  
  - [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/bookstore?type=course)  
  - [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)  
  - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)  
- Have [Github action robots](./getting_started.html) do your repetitive tasks like spell check and re-rendering.
- Use automagic conversion to ease the lift of prepping the material for different platforms' formats.  
- Use [our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jhudsl/course_template) for consistency across authors as well as to help you [avoid dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).  
  - Or, [customize your own Docker image](./customize-docker.html)  
- Follow our guides to [customize the style of your course](./customize-style.html) to show your own branding.
