## OTTR course

Here's an example of a course made with the [main OTTR Template](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template) and has been published in three platforms: Bookdown, Leanpub and Coursera.

_Introduction to Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics:_  

- [GitHub repository and source code](https://github.com/jhudsl/Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics)
  - [Bookdown website](https://jhudatascience.org/Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics/introduction.html)  
  - [Leanpub course](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/cancer-informatics-for-research-leaders)  
  - [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-reproducibility-cancer-informatics)  
  
## OTTR website

This website itself is an example of website only OTTR made with the spinoff repository: [OTTR_Template_Website](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template_Website).

- [GitHub repository and source code](https://github.com/jhudsl/ottr-website)  

## OTTR "baby" template

This is a template made from our main OTTR Template that is used for a set of courses being made for the [AnVIL set of cloud tools](https://anvilproject.org/)

- [GitHub repository and source code](https://github.com/jhudsl/AnVIL_Template)  

If you find yourself making a full set of courses and multiple repositories from OTTR, you may want to make a template from our template (If you need to go this route, we recommend talking directly to the OTTR maintainers by filing a GitHub issue and assigning `@cansavvy` and `@carriewright11`).
