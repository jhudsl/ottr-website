## Title
To change the title of the website, modify the `name` line of the `_site.yml` file.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Change title", echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/title.png")
```

## Modifying pages

Pages are specified in the navigation bar by the  lines that say `-text:` and `href:`.

The `-text` specifies what the navigation bar will say for that tab.

The `href` specifies which rendered Rmd file to use for that tab, it needs to be the html version of this file.

The tabs are aligned to the left in the order listed.

You can also add icons to these tabs using [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as is shown for the contact page.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Page modification", echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/page_modification.png")
```
