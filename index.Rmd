## Why OTTR?

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "OTTR helps build github based websites with less hassle. Catch potential mistakes before they go live", echo = FALSE, out.width= "400"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jhudsl/ottrproject.org/raw/main/resources/images/why-ottr.png")
```

- **No installing software needed!** - OTTR completely runs through GitHub so you don't have to render things locally or install anything on your computer!
- **Previews before you publish!** Before you publish your changes to your github based websites, take a look at the preview that OTTR automatically provides!
- **Automatic spell and url checks!** Have [Github action robots](./getting_started.html) do your repetitive tasks like spell check and re-rendering.
- **Customizable branding** Follow our guides to [customize the style of your website or course](./customize-style.html) to show your own branding.
- **[Customize your own Docker image](./customize-docker.html)** for your particular needs.
- **Code display friendly** If you plan to include code examples in your website or course use [our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jhudsl/course_template) for consistency across authors as well as to help you [avoid dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

## OTTR for courses

OTTR originally started as a way to publish full online courses. If this is your interest, OTTR can help you write 1 course but publish it in three places!

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "OTTR provides tools for customized spell check, checks for broken urls, checks for formmating, and tools to convert and render files to be compatible across publishing platforms to allow you to publish on  bookdown, Leanpub, and coursera more easily", echo = FALSE, out.width= "400"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/raw/main/resources/screenshots/OTTR_Robot_Image.png")
```

- Edit and write a course in [R Markdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and have it published to multiple different platforms:  
  - [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)
  - [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/bookstore?type=course)  
  - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)  
- Use automagic conversion to ease the lift of prepping the material for different platforms.
